The “0x05. N queens” project is a classic problem in computer science and mathematics, known for its application of the backtracking algorithm to place N non-attacking queens on an N×N chessboard. To successfully complete this project, you will need to understand several key concepts and have access to resources that will help you grasp the necessary algorithms and techniques.

### Concepts Needed:

1.  **Backtracking Algorithms**:
    
    *   Understanding how backtracking algorithms work to explore all potential solutions to a problem and backtrack when a solution cannot be completed.
    *   [Backtracking Introduction](/rltoken/Gbaz9HkwvR9FX4zjBt9dSw "Backtracking Introduction")
2.  **Recursion**:
    
    *   Using recursive functions to implement backtracking algorithms.
    *   [Recursion in Python](/rltoken/X1vaNXgy_pPyvKfOJm90XQ "Recursion in Python")
3.  **List Manipulations in Python**:
    
    *   Creating and manipulating lists, especially to store the positions of queens on the board.
    *   [Python Lists](/rltoken/P3KbYxmdtSeoJvVfr9Iv0w "Python Lists")
4.  **Python Command Line Arguments**:
    
    *   Handling command-line arguments with the `sys` module.
    *   [Command Line Arguments in Python](/rltoken/2IF4V6xsY_Nq-xcGDK3Bhw "Command Line Arguments in Python")

By studying these concepts and utilizing the resources provided, you will be equipped with the knowledge required to implement an efficient solution to the N queens problem using Python. This project not only tests programming and problem-solving skills but also offers an excellent opportunity to learn about algorithmic thinking and optimization techniques.
